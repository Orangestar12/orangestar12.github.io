        <p>An arcade/rec center recently opened where I live named <a href="https://www.keepongamingllc.com/" target="_blank">Keep On Gaming LLC<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External)" class="linker" /></a>. I had the privlage of attending its soft opening after the locale's tumultuous battle to even get its business license. Afterwards, Google Maps asked me to leave a review of the place, and I couldn't think of what I wanted to say at first.</p>
        <p>It's been about two weeks since that day, I've been thinking about what I want to write for quite a while now, but I've finally decided.</p>    
        <p>I have way too much to say about this place.</p>
        <h2 style="clear:both;">Good Start</h2>
        <p><strong>My review sways positive.</strong> The reason being that <strong>I want to encourage this kind of business</strong>— especially in a town like this which not only benefits from the college and family town convergence, but also could sorely benefit from recreational activity centers like this.</p>
        <p>Ages ago, when I worked for Subway, I often got teens and collegiate young adults asking if there was "anything to do around here" at the start of a semester, unable to suggest anything beyond good eateries. This was always something that would weigh on my mind as an unfulfilled niche for the town.</p>
        <p>It's good to see somebody else having a similar idea. The existing arcade is a childish ticket muncher associated with a roller rink, and the only equivalent experience I can think of beyond that is a bowling alley.</p>
        <h2>The Role Of The Arcade</h2>
        <p>There's something to be said about <strong>the arcade as an experience</strong>.</p>
        <p>Part of the allure of an arcade is <strong>the ability to do something that you otherwise would not be able to</strong> due to space, logistics, or costs. The modern, popular example would be VR setups with exclusive, arcade-specific games, and the vintage equivalent would be Pinball or simulator cabinets that are too prohibitively expensive. Anywhere can have an arcade cabinet, but you can't fit a whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(1983_video_game)" target="_blank">Star Wars (1983)<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt="(Wikipedia)" class="linker" /></a> in a pizza joint.</p>
        <div class="figurehack"> <!-- dumb hack -->

                <figcaption>I mean, you could... but where?<br><a class="small" href="https://www.progettosnaps.net/index.php" target="_blank">Image courtesy of the fantastic Progetto Snaps<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External)" class="linker" /></a></figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>Another would be a <strong>museum-like quality</strong> associated with classic or historic video games. An unintended side effect in the medium of the arcade game is a shortsightedness with regards to its presentation. As a result, modern arcades tend to 50/50 between real arcade hardware and restorations or emulations using MAME or simply hooking the PCBs up to better CRTs or less-flimsy housings.</p>
        <p>The intention, of course, being that allure of playing a classic game as designed, start to finish. Physical, interactable history.</p>

            <figcaption>As an example, this video by TNT Amusements provides a great breakdown of how the problems with Atari's <i>720°</i>'s top-heavy cabinet were mitigated.<br><span class="small">(The whole video's great, but the thing I'm specifically talking about starts at <script>document.write('<a class="yt-seek-link" data-player="0" data-time="298">');</script>4:58<script>document.write('</a>');</script>.)</span></figcaption>

        <p>I believe this area of "being a proper arcade" is what makes Keep On Gaming fall flat.</p>
        <h3>The Winners</h3>
        <p>I took note of what people were drawn to. Most played billiards, a game that is often difficult to find in the wild as it tends to be associated with bars and other adult establishments, so it makes sense that would be the big winner.</p>
        <p>The second most popular items were the custom sim racer setups. For my money, this is the big ticket item for Keep On Gaming. These stations were constantly filled, had readily-set-up games where people could hop in, but had a high skill ceiling that challenged players. If a reasonable arcade sim or a manual leaderboard system could be set up this would definitely keep repeat customers.</p>
        <p>This would fit the primary theme of "Arcade as Cost-effective Experience" as I had previously mentioned. The Sim Racer setups are wholly custom builds with high quality materials, last-gen consoles, and </p>
