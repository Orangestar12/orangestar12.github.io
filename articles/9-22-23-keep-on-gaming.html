            <p>An arcade/rec center recently opened where I live named <a href="https://www.keepongamingllc.com/" target="_blank">Keep On Gaming LLC<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External)" class="linker" /></a>. I had the privlage of attending its soft opening after the locale's tumultuous battle to even get its business license. Afterwards, Google Maps asked me to leave a review of the place, and I couldn't think of what I wanted to say at first.</p>
            <p>It's been about two weeks since that day, I've been thinking about what I want to write for quite a while now, but I've finally decided.</p>
            <p>I have way too much to say about this place.</p>

            <h2 style="clear:both;" id="good-start">Good Start</h2>
            <p><strong>My review sways positive.</strong> The reason being that <strong>I want to encourage this kind of business</strong>— especially in a town like this which not only benefits from the college and family town convergence, but also could sorely benefit from recreational activity centers like this.</p>
            <p>Ages ago, when I worked for Subway, I often got teens and collegiate young adults asking if there was "anything to do around here" at the start of a semester, unable to suggest anything beyond good eateries. This was always something that would weigh on my mind as an unfulfilled niche for the town.</p>
            <p>It's good to see somebody else having a similar idea. The existing arcade is a childish ticket muncher associated with a roller rink, and the only equivalent experience I can think of beyond that is a bowling alley.</p>

            <h2 id="the-role-of-the-arcade">The Role Of The Arcade</h2>
            <p>There's something to be said about the arcade as an experience.</p>
            <p>Part of the allure of an arcade is <strong>the ability to do something that you otherwise would not be able to</strong> due to space, logistics, or costs. The modern, popular example would be VR setups with exclusive, arcade-specific games, and the vintage equivalent would be Pinball or simulator cabinets that are too prohibitively expensive. Anywhere can have an arcade cabinet, but you can't fit a whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_2" target="_blank">The House of the Dead 2 Deluxe<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt="(Wikipedia)" class="linker" /></a> cabinet in a pizza joint.</p>

                    <img src="./9-22-23-keep-on-gaming-assets/hotd2.jpg" alt="The House of the Dead 2 Deluxe arcade cabinet."/>
                    <figcaption>I mean, you could... but where?<br><a class="small" href="https://www.gameandsportworld.com/products/sega-house-of-the-dead-2-super-deluxe-arcade-game" target="_blank">Image cribbed without permission from Game and Sport World<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External)" class="linker"/></a></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Another would be a <strong>museum-like quality</strong> associated with classic or historic video games. An unintended side effect in the medium of the arcade game is a shortsightedness with regards to its presentation. As a result, modern arcades tend to 50/50 between real arcade hardware and restorations or emulations using MAME or hooking the PCBs up to better CRTs or less-flimsy housings.</p>
            <p>The intention, of course, being that allure of playing a classic game as designed, start to finish. Physical, interactable history.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I believe this area of "being a proper arcade" is what makes Keep On Gaming fall flat.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 id="the-winners">The Winners</h2>
            <p>I took note of what people were drawn to. Most played billiards, a game that is often difficult to find in the wild as it tends to be associated with bars and other adult establishments, so it makes sense that would be the big winner.</p>
            <section>
                <h3 id="the-sim-racer-setups">The Sim Racer Setups</h3>
                <p>The second most popular items were the custom sim racer setups. <strong>For my money, this is the big ticket item for Keep On Gaming.</strong> These stations were constantly filled, had readily-set-up games where people could hop in, but had a high skill ceiling that challenged players. If a reasonable arcade sim or a manual leaderboard system could be set up this would definitely keep repeat customers as players jockey for fast times, perhaps with different tracks every week or month.</p>
                <p>I speak of this mostly from experience. Among users in the arcade-game-centric chatroom I inhabit, the current hot-ticket item is <em>WANGAN MIDNIGHT MAXIMUM TUNE 5</em>, an arcade racer in the <em>Wangan</em> franchise by Namco. Users can play online versus others, but most importantly you can save your fastest time and challenge friends to beat it. Challenge and competition breed repeat play, and if the payment model of the establishment is pay-once-play-all, having something enticing like this for repeat customers is within their best interest.</p>
                <p>This would fit the primary theme of "Arcade as Cost-effective Experience" as I had previously mentioned. The Sim Racer setups are wholly custom builds with high quality controllers, force-feedback setup, and last-gen consoles. All of these things are prohibitively expensive for a single person to purchase, but for 10 dollars a pop are an alluring prospect for a night of fun.</p>

                <h3 id="arcade-competition-and-the-internet">Arcade Competition and The Internet</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, though, KOG seems unwilling to consider any of these machines in a competitive aspect whatsoever. It feels like the idea started and ended at "If you build it they will come."</p>
                <p><strong>The building has no internet.</strong> No Wi-Fi means no arcade livestreams - these are popular on Tiktok, Twitch.TV, and the previously-popular Periscope (soon to be X Live) and would be a great advertising gamut. The machines aren't linked to any router and definitely not linked to each other, so competitive gameplay among the sim racing setups is completely impossible. Even outside of that, many modern consoles require internet connectivity and subscription to make the most of the experience. Without Xbox Live, Forza Horizons - which KOG touts out quite often - is bereft of life. It's like driving through a ghost town of RC cars.</p>
                <p>This leaves AI races and time attack. The former become woefully exploitable and predictable with modern video games. (Especially ones with assists.) The latter, without a leaderboard, leaves it entirely up to you to take a photo of your time and call it a day.</p>
                <p>I understand the intention of no WiFi is to "get offline and play couch co-op in person" but if the building is particularly quiet and you don't have a firend to bring there's very little to entice you beyond score chasing. And if it <em>is</em> busy, why even go to the single-player sim racing setups anyway if its gonna take 30 minutes to play two qualifiers and a main event in <em>SRX: The Game</em>? <strong>It will take an hour to compare times for a single 37 lap event</strong> with the easy-mode AI bumbling around.</p>
                <p>Linked sim racer setups are a staple of the arcade, from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48JRLV3Fcmg" target="_blank">massive 8-player <em style="white-space:nowrap;">Daytona USA</em> cabinet from 1994<img src="/res/youtube.svg" alt="(Youtube Link.)" class="linker"/></a> to the much less impressive 8-player <em>Fast & Furious: Super Bikes</em> by Raw Thrills. It allows players to hop on and compete to add an additional layer of difficulty into a game without needing specific, explicit consent to do so like saying "I got next" in a fighting game.</p>
                <p>The whole sim setup seems half-baked at best. The fact that it's the most enticing thing should reveal just how poorly the rest of the building is planned out even before I continue.</p>

            <p>They're not real.</p>
            <section>
                <h3 id="enter-arcade1up">Enter Arcade1Up</h3>
                <p>Let me explain. Arcade1Up is a production company that seeks to recreate retro arcade machines in an affordable, mass-produceable way, usually for home use more than business use. Their machines are 3/4 the scale of a real arcade cabinet, often have cheap, easily-acquireable parts (the buttons are actually <a href="https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1586415333757243393" target="_blank">mechanical keyboard keycaps<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External link.)" class="linker"/></a>) and reproduceable fiberglass. The intention was to create cheap and accessible options to play classic arcade games in a format similar to their original design, usually for enthusiasts and collectors who want to support these kinds of classic games. I would compare their business favorably to the modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_(game_company)" target="_blank">Stern Pinball<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" class="linker" alt="(Wikipedia link.)"/></a></p>
                <div class="figurehack">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./9-22-23-keep-on-gaming-assets/cabinets.jpg" alt="A comparison of real arcade cabinets next to their Arcade1Up equivalents."/>
                        <figcaption>Compare the real arcade cabinets (left) to their Arcade1Up variants. From top to bottom: Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition "Big Blue" cab, Turtles in Time. Note how the Arcade1Up cabinets are clearly built from a similar Capcom-like mould while the real cabinets have per-company flourish and design.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>But the thing about an Arcade1Up cabinet is that it's not a "real" cabinet. It's real in the sense that it exists, has a video game, and you can play it. However, it isn't how those games originally shipped, if you understand.</p>
                <p>The DIP switches can be immediately accessed by the player, destroying any mistique or challenge the cabinet might set for players and making score-chasing and leaderboards completely irrelevant.</p>
                <p>The design of the cabinets are painfuly sandwiched between modern sensibilities and throwback archival. Buttons on 4-player cabinets can sometimes be at awkward positions for certain games to keep the theming and classic touch of playing these games for real, but additional buttons like a volume knob, a gigantic "LIVE" button to immediately activate online play, and a headphone plug completely break any sort of immersion this design decision was intended to evoke. (Real arcade machines hid the volume knobs in a coin door. You could just make an aesthetic, swing-out door to hide these buttons. Why didn't they do that?)</p>
                <div class="figurehack">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./9-22-23-keep-on-gaming-assets/nba_jam_cpo.jpg" alt="A close up of an Arcade1Up NBA Jam Control Panel."/>
                        <figcaption>The Arcade1Up NBA Jam Control Panel. The WiFi LIVE button is visible in the center.<br/><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/u1s62p/arcade1up_sent_me_the_lit_deck_protector_and_a/">Image by New_1uper on Reddit.<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External link.)" class="linker"/></a></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Classic arcade cabinets are unique in that they can teach a player immediately how to play through a Control Panel Overlay and specifically labeled buttons, but in a system with multiple games - especially multiple games with multiple control layouts - the button layouts have to be universal to make sense. Fire and SuperZapper in <em>Tempest</em> are actually Rotate Left and Rotate Right in <em>Gravitar</em>. How many kids are going to sit at the machine with a giant trackball in the center, a dial on the side, two buttons on the left and three on the right, and confusedly spin every single control scheme wondering why they aren't getting any results?</p>
                <p>The screens are LEDs instead of CRT TV screens - particularly evident on games with a lot of 60hz flicker. Any Atari vector game is rendered out with raster graphics instead, and without that particular "glow" things like player bullets are prohibitively small and hard to see. Just try playing <em>Asteroids</em> when the "one vertex wide" bullets are 1 <em>pixel</em> wide instead.</p>
                <p>The cabinets are <em>small.</em> I keep mentally comparing the cabinets at KOG with the real cabinets at <a href="https://www.1984arcade.com/" target="_blank">1984 in Springfield<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External Link.)" class="linker"></a>. I think about the specific, particular joysticks for games like <em>Tapper</em> compared to the one-size-fits-all joysticks on the 1Up cabinets. Most importantly, I think about the size. I could comfortably sit beside by brother and play <em>Joust</em> on a full-size cabinet, but when attempting to play <em>Darkstalkers</em> at KOG we were shoulder to shoulder.</p>
                <p>All these little things add up in your mind as you play these cabinets. It adds to the feeling that the place just... doesn't care. We'll get back to that.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3 id="less-is-more">Less is More?</h3>
                <p>The appeal, of course, is that a real version of - for example - "ST" (<em>Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo</em>) is around $800 used. An Arcade1Up replica, however, is peaking at $250 used. Collectors drive prices up, and as long as supply is available then these items are much more appealing for someone looking to make the most bang for their buck. Plus, they often come with multiple different games, which looks like a bonus on paper. Why buy one cabinet with one copy of Street Fighter 2, when you could buy three cabinets with <em>every</em> version of SF2?</p>
                <p>These sorts of one-size-fits-all cabinets aren't uncommon, but they're usually for the sorts of games that would have similar button layouts - the traditional "six button grid" or "four in a row" style, like the ever-popular <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.arcadeotaku.com/w/Sega_New_Astro_City">Sega<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External Link.)" class="linker"></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.arcadeotaku.com/w/Taito_Egret_3">Taito<img src="/res/external_link.svg" class="linker" alt="(External Link.)"/></a> "Candy Cabs" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Geo_(system)" target="_blank">the famous Neo-Geo "Red Top" Multi-Video System<img class="linker" src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt="(Wikipedia link.)"/></a>.</p>
                <p>Though, these machines are built to keep costs low and make upgrades common. A single candy cabinet can be swapped out with a different board to change the available games day in and day out, or multiple cabs can have copies of a single game for comfortable networked play like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcade-projects.com/threads/universal-jamma-versus-kit.9787/">Universal JAMMA versus kit<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External Link.)" class="linker"></a>.</p>
                <p>For a true enthusiast you can always make your own machine. While real cabinets with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_video_game#Technology" title="Wikipedia: Arcade Video Game: Technology">all parts<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt="" class="linker"></a> intact are expensive, you can buy just the board for almost half of that. That's the real guts of the machine: the part that runs the code and "plays the game". Buy your own CRT at a Goodwill and follow some MAME cabinet tutorials to build your own housing with a 70 dollar bag of buttons from Amazon, and you can shave almost 200 dollars off the price for an authentic, like-new cabinet.</p>
                <p>Also, while the prospect of 1 machine having multiple games sounds like a great idea in the prospect of repeat customers, you can't exactly have someone playing <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom</em> if the machine being used to play it is currently running a game of <em>Children of the Atom</em>.</p>
                <p>This little side-rant is mostly to show that you can have low-cost methods of doing a "real" arcade without resorting to Arcade1Up's replicas. Even if you end up just buying a non-working PCB to dump the roms from, you can slap those in a MAME cabinet and get a usable, personal emulation-based cab.</p>

                <p>You might notice, however, that I said "$250 used." New Arcade1Ups are slightly less expensive than classic arcade PCBs, and the new "Pro" cabinets cost almost $1,000 if you want a truly accurate replica.</p>
                <p>It would be worth it to buy them for a fresh, new machine with all the parts working, then, right?</p>
                <p>Too bad Keep On Gaming chose to entirely buy used Arcade1Up cabinets.</p>

                        <figcaption>Not only is this tiny cabinet clearly intended to be put on a riser or table (which is missing), but the art has been eaten away and there are visible scratches all over the wood. You can't tell from the photo, but the joystick is loose and wobbly too. This machine should be only 5 years old at max!</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Yep! They're not just cheap replicas, they're cheap versions of cheap replicas. Every single machine is clearly purchased secondhand, which makes it feel like you're playing a scaled up version of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/38790792-D2BE-4E6B-97DB-FF4388D37300" title="This is an Amazon link, but I am not affiliated with Super Impulse Tiny Arcade at all.

                <p>The early 1Up cabs are clearly missing risers or intended to be placed on tables, which means that most people will have to squat down uncomfortably to play it unless you're like 6 years old or younger. As someone who's 6'4", this is horrible for my back. The most feature-filled of the Capcom fighter machines is so low to the ground that the stool next to it seats you higher than the cabinet's control panel. If you plan to run <em>Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</em> sets at this location you'll probably need to bring a nightstand just to prevent bad backs.</p>

                        <figcaption>I should have taken more wide shots of the cabinets. This selfie has a good visual of the sheer difference between the heights of the <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Pac-Man</em> cabinets when positioned next to <em>Frogger</em> and <em>Star Wars (1983)</em>.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>I can't tell if this is a plastic cover you're supposed to remove before putting this machine on the floor, or a plastic overlay intended to protect the art underneath. Either way, the fact this machine is being showcased in this condition is, I think, emblematic of the amount of care (or lack thereof) from the staff at Keep On Gaming.</figcaption>

                <p>One of the machines (the just-mentioned Capcom cab) is blatantly jailbroken, with a visible SNES emulator and loads of questionably-obtained ROMs right on the front page.</p>

                        <figcaption>Check out that default Android APK developer icon. Yes, because I want to go to the arcade and sit down at a machine that <em>has Final Fight on it</em> to instead play an inferior version of that game in the form of Final Fight Guy.<br/><br/>By the way, not only does the SNES menu play jarring, +20db SF2 voice clips every time you press any button, but you can't escape any of these to menus to the top level menu without rebooting the entire cab.</figcaption>

                <p>That's it. That's arguably a lot, but you'll notice a lot of cabinets have overlap. Two are identical and several have additional games thrown in almost as an afterthought. Some games are straight up inferior: the Pac-Man cabinet is completely superceded by the full Namco cabinet unless you really expect the original Pac-Man to be that popular. Cabs that don't have overlap have very few games which mean they're unlikely to have as many players, or have too many games which means players will have to wait if the cabinet is occupied. Most of the games are lopsided into that one SF2 cabinet that I'm not entirely certain is entirely legit. Imagine going to the arcade because you <em>know</em> they have a copy of Crystal Castles with a working trackball that you'd love to practice on only to find someone playing Gravitar and pumping "quarters" in every time they die.</p>
                <p>Arcade1Up is only doing deals with companies who are interested in these kinds of cheap replicas, which shortens the pool of what Keep On Gaming can acquire unless they start branching out. Sega is still making Arcade games, so there's no <em>Virtua Fighter</em>, <em>Space Harrier</em>, <em>Puyo Puyo Tsuu</em>. Neo-Geo never returned to the arcades and has no intention licensing their odd hardware, so no <em>Metal Slug</em>, <em>King of Fighters</em>, <em>Super Dodge Ball</em>. No stand-up racers means no <em>Pole Position</em>, <em>Out Run</em>, <em>Cruis'n</em>. No light gun games means no <em>Time Crisis</em>, <em>House of the Dead</em>, <em>Virtua Cop</em>. No arcade games that can't be emulated means no <em>Ghost Squad</em>, <em>Silent Scope</em>. No games in legal limbo means no <em>WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game</em>. No imports means no <em>WANGAN</em>, <em>TGM</em>, or exclusive arcade releases of games like <em>Akatsuki Blitzkampf</em>.</p>
                <p>Even inside of these limitations, several genres are woefully underrepresented. After 1990 the only scrolling shooters available are a few Capcom entries. No <em>Gradius</em>, <em>Salamander</em>, <em>Sonic Wing</em>, <em>Raiden</em>, <em>Truxton</em>, <em>Aero Fighters</em>, <em>Shining Force</em>. No rhythm games whatsoever, a genre thriving via subscription service in arcades even today. No <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>, <em>Pop'N'Music</em>, <em>Beatmania</em>. No twin-stick shooters means no <em>Robotron</em> or <em>Smash TV</em>. Hell, there's not even <em>Berzerk</em>!</p>
                <p>I'm not looking these up, these are just off the top of my head. None of these options are available in Keep On Gaming, which makes the whole selection feel anemic when you see 3 cabinets set to play Street Fighter, two set to play Mortal Kombat, and an entire lineup of beat-em-ups. It's like an arcade selection for someone whose knowledge of the arcade stopped at <em>Galaga</em> and is only vaguely aware of the moral panic when <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Street Fighter 2</em> got ported to the Super Nintendo.</p>

            <p>If you're still planning to visit Keep On Gaming, here's some dumb things you can do at the arcade cabinets that would normally get you beat up if the cabinets weren't set to free play.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo</h3>
                <p>Pick "Old Zangeif" by selecting Zangeif and pressing <span class="buttons">4666Jab</span> before the character select finishes. (Or, just play regular Super Street Fighter 2.) If you did it right, your character won't have a super bar. Every time you get hit or block, do <span style="white-space:nowrap">360 <span class="buttons">Forward</span></span> and you will grab your opponent as a reversal regardless of location.</p>

                <p>Pick Ken. Knock your opponent out with <span class="buttons">236Short/Forward/Roundhouse</span> and keep spamming it. The round won't end until you want it to or your hands hurt, whichever comes first.</p>

                <h3>Avengers in Galactic Storm</h3>
                <p>Convince someone to fight you in <i>Avengers in Galactic Storm</i>. This is the hardest step of the process, but the other games on that cabinet are a garbage quarter-munching Konami brawler that people give a pass solely for its X-Men license and a garbage Double Dragon ripoff by Data East, so it's not a completely unlikely scenario.</p>
                <p>The best assist in the game is Iron Man. Instead, pick Thunderstrike and, as long as we're doing dumb over practical, pick Giant Man for your assist.</p>
                <p>Thunderstrike has a pair of corner throw loops. From a <span class="buttons">6A</span> throw you can get a <span class="buttons">st.D</span>, special cancel to <span class="buttons">41236A</span> fireball, and set up another throw. Or, if you don't care, <span class="buttons">4A</span> to <span class="buttons">214A</span> is a faster and easier loop for moderately less damage.</p>
                <p>The problem, however, is that it only works in the corner. That's where Giant Man comes in. If you get in and get a throw on your opponent outside of the corner, you can have Giant Man pick up the next throw for you. Whats more, it's animation is long and it launches, so you get the full combo afterwards without the corner. And when you hit the combo, you'll have pushed them from <span class="define" title="In a fighting game, the distance to your opponent is refferred to by how much of the screen that distance takes up. &quot;Fullscreen&quot; is max distance. &quot;Midscreen&quot; is approximately the same distance both players are at the start of the round.">midscreen</span> <em>into</em> the corner.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>You won't be able to do this on round 1 since assists are metered, but you have one round to show them the normal throw loop after cornering your opponent, and another to use Giant Man for the setup.</p>
                <p>If they complain, tell em to "just jump out of it bro throws aren't that cheap."</p>
                <p>If you want something a little more technically demanding, pick Crystal with Thor as an assist. She's got this disgusting <span class="define" title="In a fighting game, any situation you set up where your opponent needs to guess what you're about to do is called a &quot;mixup&quot;, with the goal being to &quot;mix&quot; up your moves so your opponent attempts to defend the wrong thing.">mixup</span> after a knockdown. The longest mix goes from the 5-way 50/50 to another 50/50 and then a sweep. Sometimes the jump-in <span class="define" title="Since you have to hold away from your opponent to block in a fighting game, moves that hit really deep will make your opponent block the wrong way and get hit. This is called a cross up.">crosses up</span>. Sometimes it hits same-side and the high hit immediately <em>afterwards</em> crosses up. Sometimes the high whiffs, which can catch you a counterhit if your opponent is mashing. Every combo ends in a sweep and every "empty" jump ends in a throw, which gives you a knockdown and <em>another</em> full mixup setup.</p>

                <p>Use her fireball <span style="white-space:nowrap">(<span class="buttons">41236A</span>)</span> to keep yourself safe for the jump-in. A new player will respect you enough to block it. Once you get meter, Thor covers the entire screen with his assist, which makes the jump-in even safer.</p>
