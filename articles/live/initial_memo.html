        <p>When it comes to allegations like the ones that have been levied against our staff members it's important to respond quickly and concisely so people can feel calm and comfortable with the situation. In these sort of situations it is incredibly common that the first shot fired tends to win the war of public perception. One needs to strike swiftly before the history book relegates your response with the phrase "in retrospect."</p>
        <p>In an equal parameter, of course, it's important to take such a response with deliberate patience to prevent onesself from saying something misleading or emotionally charged. This can make the situation worse if not taken with care and consideration.</p>
        <p>I don't want to make any sweeping nitty gritty calling out of anyone who has made these accusations towards me yet. I've already said a few things in public spaces that may or may not have tainted how people will speak of me during the interim. These allegations were released during a day and time where I had a lot on my plate so I could not talk at length about the situation, and I fear this may have already tainted people's perception of the situation.</p>
        <p>All I am willing to say right now is that the allegations against me and our staff team are not true <strong>to the extent that they have accused me.</strong> I'm not blameless in the situation but I've had more than enough character witnesses and *legitimate* witnesses who will hold me accountable for everything I have done, and I will more than take responsibility for whatever truths exist in these allegations.</p>
        <p>However, I believe that it is important for me to gather my thoughts on the matter before I say anything definite. I will keep the community informed about this. Expect me to be more distant from the community at large while I'm writing. I've left some suggestions to the mods/admins still in power and I'm willing to relenquish my ownership if the need arises while I'm indisposed.</p>
        <p>Until then.</p>
