            <p>Linux is cool because if something breaks I know I can usually fix it myself instead of waiting for an upstream patch from a corporation to eventually fix my issue.</p>
            <p>However, heavy lifting is hard sometimes, and finding results on the internet sucks because of SEO stupidity.</p>
            <p>So here's my attempt to solve the problem without making a five-trillion-line Gist and praying to Steve Ballmer that it shows up on Google or Bing or Dog Pile.</p>
            <p>May you attain enlightenment:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You're out of disk space, and even though you've checked your Steam game installs and whatnot, your system still seems to be using a lot of space in concentrated folders.</li>

                <h4>What's happening?</h4>
                <p>This one's more of a rambling shot-in-the-dark. Linux distros love caching packages on your system for downgrading and reinstallation reasons, but that can eat a lot of space on your drive if you're expecting the machine to "just clean it up."</p>

                  <h5>Empty Caches</h5>
                  <p>You probably are already under the assumption you've cleaned all your caches but, just as a sanity check, let's double check together.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Your home directory often has a folder named <code>.cache</code>, which can be safely deleted.</p>
                      <code class="block">rm -r ~/.cache</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>If you desperately need a little bit of space right now or you just did something memory intensive, you can safely run</p>
                      <code class="block">sudo rm -r /tmp/*</code>
                      <p>to clean the <code>/tmp/</code> folder. Ignore all errors.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><code>apt</code> users can clean their package cache with</p>
                      <code class="block">apt clean</code>
                      <p>Meanwhile, <code>pacman</code> users should use </p>
                      <code class="block">pacman -Scc</code>
                      <p class="small">(<code>yay</code> has an identical command for cleaning its AUR cache as well.)</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Individual apps may have their own cache folders. Dig around with <code>baobab</code> or Filelight.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h5>Delete old packages.</h5>
                  <p>This one might seem like a no-brainer, but I'm not about to tell you to just uninstall old apps you're not using.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Flatpak doesn't uninstall necessary dependencies immediately when you uninstall all applications that use those dependencies. I assume this is so it doesn't need to re-download them if you download a new app that uses that same dependency but like, come on. Everyone is using different revisions of each dependency. You can safely clean them.</p>
                      <code class="block">sudo flatpak uninstall --unused<br/>
                      sudo flatpak repair</code>
                      <p>I highly recommend using <code>sudo</code> here even if you primarily use Flatpak in userspace because sometimes they install to the system anyway, and the Flatpak cache can be tempermental to <code>repair</code> if you're not doing it as an admin.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><code>apt</code> users can get away with just</p>
                      <code class="block">apt autoremove</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><code>pacman</code> should automatically handle your unused dependencies, but they can occur. Follow <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#Removing_unused_packages_(orphans)">the Arch Wiki's information on removing unused packages <img src="/res/external_link.svg" class="linker" alt="External link"/></a>.</p>
                      <code class="block">pacman -Qdtq | pacman -Rns -</code>
                      <p>In the future, you can uninstall packages with <code>-Rs</code> instead of <code>-R</code> to aggressively uninstall dependencies. You can also use <code>--asdeps</code> during installation to flag a package to be uninstalled when it's no longer required, or <code>--asexplicit</code> to do the opposite and never automatically uninstall a package, even with the above command.</p>
                      <p class="small">If the package is already installed, <code>pacman -D --asdeps [package]</code> will modify the package's metadata in the database without reinstalling the app.</p>

                    <h4>What's happening?</h4>
                    <p>A couple of things.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Steam itself manages the WINEPREFIXes used by Proton when you launch a game through it. The Prefix will be stored in the same <code>/steamapps/</code> folder that your game is installed under, inside a folder named <code>/compatdata/</code>.</p>
                            <figure>
                              <img src="/res/linux/Screenshot_20240227_013224.png" alt="A screenshot of the steamapps folder, showing the compatdata folder highlighted and some example internals.">
                            </figure>
                            <p>The folders in here are all organized relative to the game's Steam App ID.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Non-Steam games will use an automatically generated App ID.</li>
                                <li>Games launched via Proton outside of steam will use a default folder named <code>/0/</code>.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The folder contains relevant Proton information, and the prefix itself is under a child folder named <code>/pfx/</code>. There will also be backups of old, corrupted prefixes and custom-compiled versions of certain applications, such as GStreamer, in this folder.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Proton is a Python-based wrapper around Wine, setting up game or engine-specific fixes as well as DXVK and managing the WINEPREFIX. Whatever you have the environment variable set to will be overwritten by Proton. Instead of just, you know, checking those environment variables and assuming good faith, Steam just made an entirely <em>new</em> set of environment variables for you to have to look up, and then didn't document them anywhere.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>How do I fix it?</h4>
                    <p>The environment variable you <em>should</em> be changing is this:</p>
                    <code class="block">STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH</code>
                    <p>This will create an entire Proton <code>compatdata</code> folder for you instead of a simple WINEPREFIX.</p>
                    <p>If you'd like to use this with Steam, you'll need to set it as an "advanced launch option" with this syntax:</p>
                    <code class="block">STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH="/your/compatdata/path/here" %command%</code>

                <section>
                    <h4>Symptoms and relations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You installed a Steam game to an NTFS or FAT partition.</li>
                        <li>Pressing launch in Steam causes Proton to immediately exit with no error.</li>
                        <li>Setting the environment variable <code>PROTON_LOG=1</code> generates a log with no output beyond the boilerplate showing system and game information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>What's happening?</h4>
                    <p>I think this is a Wine thing? Largely, though, it's a "Unix permissions and NTFS permissions conflicting" thing, so it's not something Valve can just "patch out" without changing a lot of default settings. Basically, NTFS sucks.</p>
                    <p>So this error is due to the location of the WINEPREFIX, or more specifically, the <a href="#proton-ignores-wineprefix">Proton <code>compatdata</code> path</a>, which is the Proton-specific variant of a WINEPREFIX.</p>
                    <p>As far as I know, Wine works by translating a program's Win16 and Win32 API calls into equivalents for your Unix/POSIX compliant system. This means that it doesn't fully implement the Windows/NTFS permission system in your filesystem, it simply translates the existing Unix permissions system <em>into</em> the NTFS permission system on the fly.</p>
                    <p>But the NTFS permission system is way more nuanced than the Unix system, and as a result some compromises have to be made when you mount an NTFS drive onto Linux. So when you have Steam try to run a game with Proton while its <code>compatdata</code> folder is <em>also</em> on that NTFS drive, then we're converting NTFS permissions into Unix permissions which are being fed into Wine and converted back into NTFS permissions. And if Windows/Wine/the Win32 app decides it needs to change those permissions on the filesystem... the whole system falls apart.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>How do I fix it?</h4>
                    <p>You've got a few options.</p>
                    <h5>1. Use a different filesystem.</h5>
                    <p>You can just go full scorched earth and replace the partition with an EXT one, or move the game to a different, non-NTFS partition.</p>
                    <p>This is definitely the "I give up" approach.</p>
                    <h5>2. Symlink your <code>compatdata</code> folder.</h5>
                    <p>This is the technical option. Since the problem isn't with the location where the game is stored and is, instead, a problem with the location where the <em>WINEPREFIX</em> is stored, you can simply put the WINEPREFIX somewhere else with normal Unix permissions and it will run fine.</p>
                    <p>If you don't know what symbolic linking is, read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link" target="_blank">the Wikipedia Page on it<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt="(Wikipedia)" class="linker"></a>.</p>
                    <p>It can be tempting to want to symlink all of your <code>compatdata</code> folders to the main one you have at <code>~/.local/share/steam/steamapps/</code>, and that's a completely valid fix. I don't recommend it, though: Steam's built-in game mover thingy will throw an error that the files couldn't be moved if all of your <code>compatdata</code> folders are pointing to the same place - frustratingly, it will only error after it already tries moving the data, which takes a lot of time. This is because the last step in Steam's moving process is to try to move the <code>compatdata</code> folder. In this case, it will try moving the folder to... the place it currently exists at. This results in an error, and Steam will abort the whole process. It will even leave an orphaned folder that you will have to manually delete in the target <code>steamapps/common</code> folder.</p>
                    <p>Instead, I recommend making a set of additional <code>compatdata</code> folders with conspicuous names in a folder not managed by Steam, and symlinking to those folders individually, so as not to cause these conflicts.</p>

                    <h4>Symptoms and relations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You're probably on Arch or a derivative.</li>
                        <li>You are running more than 1 flavor of Linux kernel.</li>
                        <li>After upgrading, booting sends you to an emergency shell.</li>
                        <li>You can prevent the shell by pressing F2 or tab and selecting a very specific kernel, usually the last one that got upgraded.</li>
                        <li>You can also fix it by meticulously managing your <code>refind.conf</code> file, but that sucks and takes time and you have to do this every time you upgrade.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>What's happening?</h4>
                    <p>By default rEFInd assumes that the end of a kernel file is its version number: like, <code>vmlinuz-linux-4.8</code> will obviously match with <code>initramfs-linux-4.8</code>, and so on with flavors like <code>initramfs-linux-zen-4.8</code>.</p>
                    <p>Arch decided to be different and spunky and doesn't put version numbers on its kernels whatsoever, so rEFInd fucks up and assumes that <code>-zen</code> <em>is</em> the version number it's looking for. As a result it will just load a random <code>initramfs</code> and <code>vmlinuz</code> file and assume they both work together. (Ok, it's not random, but it's based on which file got <code>touch</code>ed last so it's effectively random.)</p>

                    <h4>How do I fix it?</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open up <code>/boot/EFI/refind/refind.conf</code></li>
                        <li>Search for "<code>extra_kernel_version_strings</code>"</li>
                        <li>If that line is commented out, uncomment it.</li>
                        <li>Whatever is in there, make sure the last thing in the list is <code>linux</code> without anything else after it.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here's what mine is set to:</p>
                    <code class="block">extra_kernel_version_strings linux-rt-lts,linux-lts,linux-rt,linux-hardened,linux-zen,linux</code>
                    <p>While you're there, consider uncommenting the <code>fold_linux_kernels</code> option as well, which will split all your various flavors into individual bootable buttons instead of putting them all under one generic "Arch Linux" bootable option.</p>

                    <p>Valve wants all your games to run properly when you install Steam, so as a part of its package install process it will try to install proper packages as dependencies to run things like DXVK and 32-bit drivers for your hardware.</p>
                    <p>During the <code>archinstall</code> process, though, it doesn't know anything about your hardware and will just assume the correct graphics device, installing the AMD or Intel drivers in the process.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, your card won't care at all about these other drivers.</p>

                    <p>Manjaro doesn't use <code>xorg.conf</code>. At least, it does, but not directly. Anyway, quit touching it.</p>
                    <p>Arch doesn't generate an <code>xorg.conf</code> anymore by default, but that breaks spectacularly in edge cases. Because Manjaro is specifically designed to be user friendly, it overengineers a nice <code>conf</code> file setup particular for your computer when you first install it in a way that will ideally scale up well as you change your hardware.</p>
                    <p>Part of this setup involves not editing the main <code>xorg.conf</code> and instead importing a bunch of smaller <code>conf</code> files that it can swap out as it needs. These are found in <code>/etc/X11/mhwd.d/</code>, and are - of course - managed by <code>mhwd</code>.</p>

                    <p>Computers are fucking STUPID is what's happening.</p>
                    <p>So when the first few HDTVs and HD monitors came out some computers were still stuck with Extended VGA modes, and that meant they had no clue how to output to progressive scan TVs.</p>
                    <p>So the idea was instead you just tell your monitor to output to a 4:3 resolution and the TV would squish it to be 720p. Then make your video player display a stretched fullscreen image and presto, you can watch your DVDs on your computer!</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, it's now $CURRENT_YEAR and your modern day graphics card has no qualms outputting a grid of pixels, but the EDID on your TV is saying "Nooo I don't support that! Don't break your TV tuner!"</p>
                    <p>Windows just doesn't care and forcibly puts 720p as one of the resolutions available if it detects similar resolutions being reported by the TV (though that doesn't stop it from trying to set 1280x768 as the default.) X11 is a bit more strict, though, and will read the EDID and take it at its word, meaning that the resolution you need just doesn't show up.</p>

                    <p>These are wrong and the actual option isn't even in this part of the NVidia Docs. In fact, the first option straight up got deprecated without warning and doesn't work anymore. Computers are awesome <span class="small">(sarcasm)</span>.</p>
