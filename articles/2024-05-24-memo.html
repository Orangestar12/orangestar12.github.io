    <main>
        <p>I consider myself an archivalist.</p>
        <p>I try to be as transparent as possible with everything that I do, because I believe sequestering information away and being cagey are poor traits, indicative of having something to hide or generally being manipulative. I believe that when a person is given all the facts about something they can come to a well-informed decision based on what they have been told and what they have experienced.</p>
        <p>I also subscribe to an ethos of "You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide," though that ethos does not equate to "everything should be accessible to everyone." I think some things need to be kept away from people with regards to their age, confidentiality, and so on.</p>
        <p>Recently a massive breach in this confidentiality has required that I set some records straight. Many people who I consider my closest friends have been ripped away from me by people acting in bad faith. It's a distressing state of events. Please allow me to say what I can.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm not blameless. I messed up in several places and fully intend to come clean where it is relevant.</strong> I don't want this to feel like "You, the reader, have personally been lied to!" or that the claims against me are completely falsified.</p>
        <p>I don't expect to convert the opinions of those who have already indicted me. Indeed, their minds have been made up and attempting to fight back against them directly will only lead to more bad faith and people digging in their heels. This message is for those who want to know what has happened, as the alleged, speaking on my own behalf. I would like to reveal the truth. I will clearly label parts of this document that are pure fact and which ones are opinion on my own part.</p>
        <p>I would like to start with the announcement given by the parties who incriminated me, begin at the beginning, and lay the situation out in chronological order.</p>
    <h1>BEFORE WE GET STARTED</h1>
        <p>I have trusted people to not take one person's word and go running for the hills with it, and they have granted me way more trust and grace than I think I am owed. This came, however, with the caveat that I will have to answer and take responsibility for my own failings.</p>
        <p>To that end, <strong>do not use this document as an excuse to witch-hunt, harass, or otherwise defame the people being referred to in this document</strong>. That's not your job. I'm doing what I can here to set the record straight, We don't need any more defense from other people now in retrospect.</p>
        <p>Do not harass people who choose to pick a side in this debate, regardless of which side. Do not harass people for <em>refusing</em> to pick a side.</p>

    <h1 id="the-allegation">The allegation</h1>
        <p>On Sunday, May 5th, at 6PM EST, @caseybones posted this #mttnews announcement.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Due to a series of long-standing issues, maltreatment, and misalignment between us moderators’ views and management, we are leaving the moderation team and, subsequently, the server. Please check the announcement made on the subreddit if you would like to learn more, as this also marks the official de-partnering of the /r/Undertale subreddit with the Discord server.</p>
            <p>For those of you who wish to contact us, keep in touch, or remain friends, please feel free to send us friend/message requests. It was great to be a part of this community while we were here, but it's unfortunately not a community we can remain with any longer.</p>
            <p>- Signed,</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>I want to take a brief moment to mention that at the time this post had been made there was no actual subreddit post. No conversation between these users and the remaining staff had happened beforehand. This was suddenly sprung on us as much as it was sprung on the public. Everyone was thrust into complete confusion.</p>
        <!-- <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal opinion</p>
        </div> -->
        <p>After throwing the entire Discord into confusion and panic, a significant amount of time passed before <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/1cl31q5/announcement_we_have_a_new_partnered_server/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">a Subreddit post<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External link.)" class="linker"></a> was finally made.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Greetings,</p>
            <p>as of today, the subreddit has a new partnered discord server (I know, most of you weren’t aware we have one to begin with, that’s part of the issue). Reasons that lead to such result are plentiful and riddled with deep running issues, I will try to be succinct:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A history of server being poorly ran, issues often left unresolved, both interpersonal in the team and on the server administration side. Compounding this was to us recently revealed history of server letting pedophiles slip through the cracks (mind you, years back). Needless to say, we prefer not to be associated and take our chances elsewhere</li>
                <li>Tipping the scales was a recent argument involving a rather touchy subject. Sparing you the details, a deeply unhealthy relationship between two mods riddled with abuse, past grooming and trauma. What is important to our matter is, how it was handled by the current server owner, who forced a conversation neither from the involved pair wanted. It was handled incredibly poorly (at that stage there was no other way to handle it, granted) and at the end the server owner made some ridiculous accusation towards the female mod involved. Who mind you was groomed by the other mod, when she was 16 and he 22. Ended threatening to demod / ban her</li>
                <li>The two communities have drifted apart a long time ago. Nothing much more to say, it was a natural evolution, yet it means we do not get much out of partnership and neither are our users present. How this might change with this switch, we shall see</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Drach has told me after the fact that he essentially was awoken suddenly and felt pressured to push this message ASAP. Of the people who were deliberately left out of the "goings-on" with regards to this walkout, he was one of them—and is ostensibly the person who benefits the most by having a new partnered server that he is supposed to be helping out with.</p>
        <p>This post has been edited since the publishing of this memo, and was originally much more incriminating towards the administrators, directly accusing the administrators of spreading CSAM. Since it's been lost to time I need to specify that it originally framed us as pedophiles, and was edited later when the mod who posted this was informed that this was not just wrong but libelous. This isn't an opinion, this is a thing that happened.</p>
        <p>Given what Drach has said since the publication and how receptive he was to editing the message, it can be reasonably assumed he was pressured to include this segment, written in a specific way. Either that, or he simply worded the message poorly under an altered state of mind (groggy from having just woken up.)</p>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>It's worth noting that the release time was conducive to causing some significant level of grief. 7PM on a Sunday is an incredibly late time for Americans, and occurs immediately before the business work week. It particularly slowed down our ability to reply and caused doubt to stew while the accusers grew their own userbase.</p>
            <p>In Drach's country of origin, this time equates to around 1AM which is a horrible time to throw someone into this kind of a situation.</p>
            <p>Largely, I just want to point out that all around this was a poor time to send this message, and made everyone more confused than if this had been talked out.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Currently it more specifically refers to old members of the moderation team who were dealt with as soon as we were informed about their abhorrent nature, but frames it as though we allowed them to fester, confidently stating things that the mod has no knowledge of. We'll come back to this point.</p>
        <p>Shortly afterwards, a standard "callout" Google Docs document was published, intended to be evidence against the moderators and proof standing behind the need of the walkout.<!--  Notably, this document was not published publically and was originally distributed in a limited 18+ channel. --> This document was published as the initial announcement in the new server.</p>
        <div class="aside">
            <p>In the time since both the original pinned Reddit post and the Google Doc were published, both the author of the Reddit post and the writer of the original Google Doc that spread have both alleged that they did not intend to directly incriminate members of the moderation team as people who were, directly, spreading CSAM. They have since clarified that they only wish to highlight that child predators were previously allowed to maintain in positions of power for a period of time 7 years ago.</p>
            <p>So if your only problem was assuming that the mods were pedos or that we had child porn, those charges are dropped and I can confidently say that isn't true.</p>
            <p>I don't want to jump around chronologically a lot like this but some people like to skim articles, so I wanted to include this aside to alleviate people right out of the gate. Drach went back on accusing us of spreading CSAM. Marr claims she never wanted to accuse us of spreading CSAM. These are not the droids you're looking for. Leave 'em alone.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>I understand the purpose of preventing access to a document that deals with domestic abuse, child abuse, and pedophilia among a server primarily full of underaged users. However, hiding it and not even alluding it except to those people with whom you already deeply trust feels manipulative. If you have evidence, it makes sense to let people know you have the evidence rather than be coy about it and not tell anyone until they've jumped through a few hoops for you.</p>
            <p>I plan to talk about this document later on.</p>
        </div> -->
        <p>I've made a copy of this document in the off chance it gets edited or deleted. It's not that I don't trust them, it's just the internet is inherently impermanent, and if I'm hosting this page I should be hosting its required ancillary data. I will be linking the document further down the page after a mandatory disclaimer about its contents and an age gate.</p>
        <p>With that being said, here's the full facts of the story.</p>

            <p>First of all if you haven't read it, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EqSVku5rq6si8GzJfQCKKshAlaSTHp9hXMjLUwuFiHY/edit?usp=sharing">here's that Google Doc<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External link)" class="linker"></a>. Again, this is a mirror that I'm hosting to freeze it in time. It's not super relevant to this section but I don't want it to feel like I'm hiding anything from you.</p>
            <p>I'm not going to sit here and pretend the channel called <code>#little-ones</code> didn't exist because that would be lying. Yes, in our NSFW satellite server there was a channel where sexualized images of underaged characters from Undertale were featured.</p>
            <div class="aside">
                <p>Some quick clarifications before people make rash judgments about how the staff coexisted with this channel.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight:bold">No real-life instances of CSAM ever existed in this channel.</span> That doesn't make its existence okay but I want to specify that nothing <em>unambiguously</em> illegal was ever shared in this channel. That served to assist in its mask as being a "gray area" as much as it did prevent the absolute worst people from showing up in it.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight:bold">No moderator or administrator ever posted any images in this channel.</span> The running opinion among the staff at that time was that the channel existed to shut the whiners up and keep that shit out of the space of the general public, people who didn't want to see it. (The running phrase used was "containment channel", another 4chanism.) Again, this doesn't make its existence okay, it just means that <u>we</u> didn't do anything illegal, ambiguous or unambiguous.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>To explain how we got here we need to go into a LOT of history (because literally this stuff happened so close to the origin of the server.)</p>
            <p>Early Undertale Discord had some culture from 4chan integrated into it. I myself learned about Discord for the first time via word-of-mouth from Doom fans on the /vr/ board. As a result there was fraternizing between the local users and denizens of /utg/, the Undertale General thread on /vg/. This is usually what is responsible for a lot of the harsher language still in the server that some kids love to search on a whim and then dig up and go "WHY DID YOU SAY THESE SLURS BACK THEN" and we just have to be like "ok look way back then we were edgy and dumb" and then delete them because Discord loves to just nuke stuff without warning if they catch a whiff of bad publicity.</p>
            <p>Many of these early 4chan plants were the one who pushed for a channel featuring "loli" and "shota" content most of all. Initially there was pushback from the rest of the mod team. A <em>lot</em> of pushback. I only have my word on this because the users in question got banned and a lot of the text associated with it got scrubbed because <em>they were talking about child porn and we didn't want that to stay in the server after the whole situation was over.</em></p>
            <div class="p-o">
                <p class="head">Specification on phrasing</p>
                <p>I use the term "loli" and "shota" here specifically because they were the parlance at the time. There is no ambiguity on these words, they just mean "CSAM that was drawn by an artist rather than photographed". This is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)">Dog Whistle<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt='(Link to "Dog Whistle (politics)"" from Wikipedia.)' class="linker"></a>, where specific words and phrases are used to obfuscate their true meaning to people who don't know. "Oh, it's not <em>pedophilia</em>, it's just <em>loli!"</em></p>
            <!--
                this is what I had originally wrote, but then got a scond opinion re: using humor in a callout response document.
            <p>Also, note from the right-now, I use those terms "loli" and "shota" as they were parlance at the time. You will look back on these terms with your fancy future goggles and say "aren't those just fancy words for drawn CSAM" and I will look at it with my own fancy future goggles and say "yes, I see, our magic goggles of hindsight let us know this is a pedophilic dogwhistle."</p>
            -->
                <p>People are going to say I am using this as an excuse to say that I was manipulated into creating a shota channel. I believe that I was, but I don't think that fact will fully exonorate my actions. I didn't yet associate the real life horrors of child molestation with sexualized depictions of fictional minors.</p>
            </div>
            <p>That ship had to sail sometime, though. There's a rule I have on the internet: "If you have to lie, lie with the intent that you must eventually tell the truth in the future." The people who pushed for this channel were lying about connections to real life sexual abuse, and they were about to have the truth come out.</p>
        <h3 id="frickgote">Frickgote</h3>
            <p>Frickgote is an incredibly minor character in our story who is <em>incredibly pertinent to talk about</em> right now because it is personal and directly related to why that channel was deleted.</p>
            <p>The absolute minimum you need to understand is this guy was like the cult of personality for /utg/'s private Asriel fan Discord server. The server's users considered each other very close friends at some point (I never felt fully included because, as an admin for a seperate public Discord, I was like the normie trying to be cool to them) but as things tend to happen with friend groups that get too close, romantic engagements began to bloom.</p>
            <p>And because it was 4chan, some of those people were not the ages they claimed they were.</p>
            <p>Needless to say the club quickly split apart when people found out Frickgote was not only very involved with a minor but did so on purpose <em>because</em> of their status as a minor.</p>
            <p>From a personal standpoint, that was the moment where I began to completely renege my already-ill-informed-and-definitely-wrong stance on drawn CSAM and wanted that channel gone.</p>
            <div class="aside">
                <p>So I had this big long thing here about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ak3g4j/we_do_not_consider_cub_to_be_a_violation_of_our/?rdt=43186">Discord Cub Scandal</a> because I assumed that was related but it turns out no, that happened 2 years later and everyone on staff, in no uncertain terms, completely condemned it.</p>
            </div>
        <!-- <h3>The Discord Cub Scandal</h3>
            <p>Discord has mostly swept this thing under the rug and the actual nuts and bolts of what happened is lost to the sands of time somewhat so allow me to regale you with what was once the biggest PR disaster in Discord's history.</p>
            <p>Discord was getting under a lot of scrutiny around this time due to the large amount of little servers that would share REALLY illegal content, get banned like wack-a-mole, and then pop right back up barely an hour later with a new name and the same people.</p>
            <p>Attempts to squash this problem by doing broad, sweeping generalizations of how they handled their rules resulted in a whole lot of people getting banned illegitimately and a whole lot of confusion about what the terms of service even mean.</p>
            <p>One of the stories I like to repeat a lot about this period was when, in the official Partnered Servers Discord server, a community manager with r/Kanye (this was before he went full Nazi) asked if, since people were getting banned for the N word for any occasion, they would get banned for posting any rap lyrics that happened to have the N word in them.</p>
            <p>Discord didn't actually respond to this guy's request, they instead decided to double check if the r/Kanye Discord even met their partnership requirements in the first place and stripped them. Manually.</p>
            <p>So the fears asbout how these kinds of things were being handled by Discord was part of the reason for the satellite server in the first place, but then a user got <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ak3g4j/we_do_not_consider_cub_to_be_a_violation_of_our/?rdt=43186">an official response from a Discord adminstrator after reporting actual drawn furry child pornography <img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External link)" class="linker"></a> (referred to as "cub" porn).</p>
            <blockquote>

            <p>The outrage was tremendous, and people came out of the woodwork to talk about actual real life sexual abuse perpetuated by people who supported this set of CSAM. That was the catalyst for everyone else, I think, realizing that people would openly bend the rules to suit their own worldview even when unambiguously in the wrong with regards to how the rules were written.</p>

        <h3 id="madzci">Madzci</h3>
            <p>A brief section of the doc goes on to list a user by the name of Madzci and doesn't actually really go into detail about who he is, just saying "he was a pedophile, he was a mod, it's the old guard's fault."</p>
            <p>On the surface Madzci was a normal looking fellow, incredibly friendly, and eventually they made their way to a mod position on these optics.</p>
            <p>I had very little communication with this guy to be fully honest (the server was more staffed with active, bright-eyed mods so I could afford to be more hands-off), and I was completely unaware that the guy was a real predator until I had come back to find them banned after the rest of the staff did their investigative hunt and chased the guy the heck out of dodge.</p>
            <p>To suggest that I personally made that guy a mod and purposefully kept him in the server despite knowing he was a child predator smacks of historical revisionism. Admins and mods had roles that let them instate other admins and mods - I wasn't aware of the scope of this guy's actions until it all was said and done.</p>

                <p>If I was personally complicit in keeping Madzci on the staff team <em>despite</em> knowing they were a child predator people would have called me out back then rather than right now, secondhand, through another mouthpiece.</p>
            </div>
            <p>And as a little cherry on top of how that story ends, the last we heard of the guy he got his laptop seized by the FBI, so they're probably doing time. Raise a glass to that one.</p>

                <p>The document alleges they have an image that they don't want to post yet but "proves" I was complicit in allowing Madzci to remain on staff. I'll bet the image that they plan to use as evidence against me is that line where I did not know Madzci's then-abuse-victim's age and again assumed it was a domestic dispute between two people who were of age. The remaining staff chose to look into it (and let people know the full story!!!) despite my fears and the server is better for it.</p>
                <p>Madzci's situation had parallels, but the fact I chose to be more hands on with this situation is precisly because I was hands-off with the Madzci situation. To imply, because of this, that I have not changed at all, implies a lack of understanding with how the original situation developed.</p>

           <p>People that I spoke to after the walkout essentially admitted that they were either walking out for either one reason or the other: my poor handling of a domestic abuse case, or a more-than-half-decade old situation where we were manipulated by pedophiles, acted swiftly once we came to our senses, and respond with honesty and regret when it comes up today. While both played a part in their decision, one is always touted as the "turning point" for their decision.</p>

                <p>As a result, I'm convinced that the full story, had it been told, would not have resulted in  several people walking out on us. I feel it is important to set the record straight.</p>
                <p>What I'm endlessly trying to grasp here is why this talking point was even brought up at all. When I get to talking about the callout Google document itself later in this article, I'll talk more specifically about this from the perspective of how it was framed inside that document, because it reveals a lot with its presentation.</p>

    <h2 id="the-grooming-allegations-towards-nokas">The Grooming Allegations Towards Nokas</h2>
        <p>I had originally planned to include the entire doc and screencaps of the conversation in this and refute or explain as much of it as I possibly could, but everyone I had talked to, it turned out, mostly came to the exact same opinions I already currently hold. Therefore, I see no reason to be so thorough about it. People who read it see why I acted the way I did and shun the parts of it where I failed.</p>
        <p>Let's get this out of the way. I regret how that conversation went and I admit that I did more to hinder the problem with how I handled it than I did to solve the problem. I misread the situation, didn't want to act decisively against someone I had personal connections to, and let emotional baggage sway how I acted when people were clearly affected by the discussion.</p>
        <p>I tried to play the part of both trusted mediator and community leader, juggling the act of resolving a tense connection between two people with an abusive history while also trying to be impartial in how I handle it from the standpoint that I would refer to a <code>#muted</code> discussion. The biggest thing going through my mind was "I can't have two moderators with animosity affecting the strength of moderation in this server" and that was absolutely the wrong thing to be worried about in that moment.</p>
        <p>I was not the person to mediate a conversation between an abuse victim and their abuser, but I felt I had to do something due to my status as a leader. Leaders don't mediate these conversations, that's why Human Resources divisions exist.</p>

            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>I'm not being entirely forthcoming about why I handled this situation the way that I did, because it will become more relevant when we get into the actual document later. I don't mean to string you along but it's easier to organize the situation chronologically.</p>

        <p>A significant number of people, and especially people who participated in the walkout, seem convinced that for some reason it never came to my mind that I should just have Norkas banned, cut all ties, and wash my hands of the situation.<strong> This was one of the first things I asked Marr, and she said she didn't want that to happen</strong>, so I obliged.</p>

            <p>I have to put the personal opinion header on this but don't let that discourage you from counting this as part of the document.</p>
            <p>Norkas is not using language associated with abusers, he's using language associated with <em>abuse victims.</em> An abuser is unrelenting, they may regret their actions but they aren't afraid of the person they abused. They're steadfast, especially since they were the one in power during the situation.</p>
            <p>Norkas said in the conversation he was trying to atone and was in therapy for his actions. The memories haunt him and it puts strain on his relationship with his significant other.</p>
            <p>Whether you think it was right for me to side with him or not, I hope this helps you understand why I flipped to assuming Norkas was also a victim in the 2020-2021 relationship.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I did not mean "ban" here, I meant demod. That was a fucking mistake and I didn't catch it because it was 12:30 and we were all emotionally exhausted. If she had asked me about that I would have absolutely been like "wait what OH FUCK". That's another mistake on my part. I'm forced to wear that badge of shame because that absolutely was part of why people felt like they couldn't trust me anymore.</p>

        <p>There's a lot I didn't know about the situation going into it, and I think there were crossed wires about how the situation was being framed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marr had originally stated to me during the VC with her that she had broken up with Blue prior to engaging with Norkas romantically.</li>
            <li>Additionally, Marr presented the situation as though she and Norkas entered the relationship together after level conversation.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>The way this was presented felt, to me, like the situation was at least somewhat consenting from both parties, especially since both parties were previously in sexually active relationships. It was, therefore was a charge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape">statutory rape<img src="/res/wikipedia.svg" alt="(Wikipedia: Statutory rape.)" class="linker"></a> which is a completely different charge to pedophilia and child abuse - two charges that commonly come up with regards to grooming scandals.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now, however, Marr has alleged that Norkas initiated the situation to steer her away from Blue as a romantic partner, and pushed the issue of a relationship specifically with the intent of sexual contact. This is an <em>extremely</em> different scenario than what I was presented with.</p>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>Had I been initially told this instead of the story I was actually given I would have absolutely been way more harsh towards Norkas's side of the situation. I don't think Marr is lying now, but instead that she was not fully willing to accuse the other person in the relationship. This would be out of fear of retaliation, or perhaps just not being believed - which she was fully justified in assuming, of course. This was a traumatic experience for her.</p>
            <p>If you want my two cents, I'm pretty sure that this sort of a framing would have made me start a conversation with Norkas like "I've just been informed that your relationship with Marr was abusive in nature and I cannot have a person on my staff with that kind of history who is not willing to talk about it" and then they would either have to go on their own (without being allowed to write a resignation letter) or just get kicked out. I obviously can't speak for certain because I also have the personal experience of what occurred now.</p>
            <p>17-22 is a worrying age gap but without the knowledge that Norkas was the instigator <em>and</em> was deliberately acting predatoraly to a minor, there is not enough information to rightfully make claims of who's in the right and who's in the wrong, especially three years after the fact.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="obscene" data-cw="discussion of cybersex">
            <p>Marr also had focused specifically on a moment of engagement between the two of them last year which made the charge sound more serious. Later during the actual conversation it was revealed that the sexual engagement was a consensual one between two of-age parties, and that that Marr initiated the video call.</p>
            <div class="p-o">
                <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
                <p>This is another thing that steered me away from believing Marr was only acting to seek justice for her abuser. There's no crime in going to your ex and asking him to have cybersex with you, and there's no crime in your ex telling you afterwards that he regrets the sex. That's just a domestic dispute. It felt like bringing up the 2023 sexual encounter was a tactic rather than evidence, especially since I wasn't given the full story from the beginning. That's what pushed me more towards getting the two together to talk about it: I wasn't just getting two stories from two different parties, I was getting <em>three</em>. I didn't feel comfortable passing judgment without the full story, even if I should have.</p>

        <p>I'm not writing this document for Marr, Norkas, or any of the mods who walked out. Again, they've made up their minds. I see no reason to try and challenge them.</p>
        <p>I won't be contacting Norkas again in the future and he's already been banned from the server, knowing now what we wish we had known before. If your hangup was that we were too soft on him, we're trying to make good on that now and he's serving his time IRL through therapy.</p>

            <p>The question I want to levy towards you, the reader, is if the situation that happened is even relevant enough to constitute that I am not fit for my position as community leader.</p>
            <p>Did I handle the situation poorly, and opened wounds in abuse victims? Yes, and I have come to learn and grow from the situation. Now that all is said and done I understand where my faults lie and know I'm not fit to be a mediator in a situation like this.</p>
            <p>But to me, this situation feels like it was a personal matter I failed to isolate as such. I feel that the situation is being used as leverage to allege that I am not fit for my position in all other aspects.</p>
            <p>I don't actually have an expected answer that I feel like members of the community will agree on with regards to if I am to maintain in a position of power or not. I entreat this as an honest question and I will abide by the result.</p>
            <p>If you do believe that I'm not fit to be a community leader under the grounds of this and this alone, then by all means make yourself known. I am more than willing to graciously step down if the populous can come to an agreement that I am not fit to manage the community.</p>

            <p>From what I understand the purpose of these kinds of callout posts is designed on purpose to compile all evidence against a person to purposefully direct viewers towards a given conclusion.</p>
            <p>However this document is awkwardly written and formulated, beginning with a rambling explanation of Marr's relationship with Norkas, an unedited dump of the conversation with me, and then a couple of awkwardly spliced lines to implicate us in a CSAM scandal.</p>

    <h2 id="the-actual-relevant-parts">The actual relevant parts</h2>
        <p>Right out of the gate a couple of things stood out to me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As mentioned before, this was the first time I was informed that Norkas pressured Marr into the relationship. Enough doubt and specific language was omitted from the conversation to make me believe the situation was different than what is now being presented to the public.</li>
            <li>The document accuses that I "took Norkas's side during the entire confrontation" despite that being visibly not true in the conversation sent. So far everyone I've spoken to has agreed that the way that conversation was held framed the situation in a way that makes it understandable how I answered with what I did.</li>
            <li>The document accuses that I tried to make her "prove" she was a worthy moderator. That didn't happen and that line isn't even in the conversation so I don't know what it could be quoting. Perhaps it's referring to the part where I was suggesting being a moderator was a strain on their personal health?</li>
            <li>The document alleges that I pressured Marr into the group chat. I asked her, and she said she wanted to be in on it willingly. I even asked her to clarify.

                        <p>well, i don't really want to talk to him but i'm fine with being around</p>

                <p>If she didn't mean this, she didn't communicate it clearly. It was incredibly hard to tell with how she was dancing around it and she was fully capable of leaving the group chat if she had changed her mind anyway.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The most damning thing about the document isn't in it: the way it was written implies multiple people admit they had full knowledge of the situation outside of me, Norkas, and Marr. I was, basically, the last person Marr came to for help. I've since been informed these people who knew of the situation prior are Casey, Bliv, and a few third parties not inside the mod team.</p>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>This caused me to realize something horrible about this situation: Where were Marr's actual close friends when she needed them to back up her situation to the proper authorities?</p>
            <p>If all these people who signed that walkout post knew about the situation - indeed if members of staff beyond the "old guard" knew about the situation - why weren't they bringing it up to me alongside Marr to bolster her confidence and allow her to directly confront her abuser? Why was she being passed off from person to person until it had to boil over to me, leaving me as the scapegoat when I finally decide to take action with a half cup of truth?</p>
            <p>Why was Marr pushed out with a "Go Get 'Em, Tiger" and a pat on the back instead of her friends showing up with her, ready to fight alongside her?</p>
            <p>I think people didn't want to take responsibility for an action if it went south, and—now that it has—people are readily willing to take responsibility for something they believe is an inalienable truth.</p>
            <p>Keep that in your back pocket.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This was, I had told Marr, the reason I didn't want to make a big stink of it in the <code>#muted</code> channel: Being suddenly thrust into a location with the ENTIRE Staff able to see what you did would make one immediately act out, be irrational, and probably cause a LOT of bad blood to be spilled. Arguably, it would have gone worse if the situation had thrust one person suddenly under the lenses of several other people who were only just now being informed about the situation and might have been encouraged to dogpile and make their opinions known.</p>

                <p>id rather not pull all of staff in on this yet</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>However, we now know that not only did other staff members know but they, either intentionally or unintentionally, put me up to it by having Marr bring it up to me outside of any group situation. Nobody saw fit to actually come clean and admit this until it went sour.</p>
    <h2 id="the-pedophilia-accusations">The Pedophilia Accusations</h2>
        <p>This part of the document is incredibly clearly slapped together last minute by whoever compiled this collage. These screenshots are arranged and framed in a way to be incriminating however necessary, while also being ironic and hypocritical.</p>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>While I am of the opinion that this is a deliberate tactic, it's entirely possible that it was completely unintentional and was instead a heated action. Either way, it was definitely done in a slapshod, unclear manner to simply have <em>some</em> kind of "evidence".</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The document alleges that this is a "persistent issue" but does not actually have any evidence newer than 7 years ago, and more instances than two (of which both are tenuously related at best).</li>
            <li>The document censors the names of people in the screencap under the pretense that "it was 7 years ago and they may have changed their views", yet gives no such graces to the people they wish to directly incriminate in the situation.</li>
            <li>The censorship in the document is done incredibly foolhardily: Several screenshots were taken just prior to the walkout, so the names and avatars of these users can still be looked up by a simple Discord query for messages on a public community 18+ server. These messages are unintentionally incriminating people they never intended to incriminate.</li>
            <li>In a specific instance, a moderator, Obvious, is incriminated as posting "Young Asriel Porn" in a noncon format. Looking up the image is the character in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22adult+form%22+asriel">their appearance colloquially known among the community as his "Adult Form"<img src="/res/external_link.svg" alt="(External Link)" class="linker"></a>. It was obviously cropped to cause controversy on purpose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Several screenshots are specifically and visibly taken by an alt account in no other servers while the server was around. What this means is whoever chose to reveal this didn't decide to reveal it <em>when</em> the problematic channels existed, but instead decided to document its existence and then sit on it for 7 years, waiting for the perfect moment to show it to the public to make us look bad.</p>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>It also means whoever took those screenshots is probably themselves implicated in the images taken, and thus whoever chose to <em>hold onto those screenshots</em> instead of making their displeasure known are, themselves, equally as much to blame for the situation as I am for being, most likely, on the moderation team that let that channel exist.</p>
            <p>Basically, what I'm saying is, if you think I defend pedophiles because of screenshots taken 7 years ago, then whoever sent those screenshots is <em>also</em> a pedophile for deciding to take those screenshots 7 years ago. It's the Spec-Ops: The Line excuse; "I&nbsp;only did it because I was under orders to do so!"</p>
            <p>If you want to incriminate us for using the actual phrase of abuse "rape" in a joking manner due to us being ex-4chan refugee edgelords at the time when we now know better, I guess you can do that but it feels incredibly silly.</p>
        </div>
    <h2 id="the-walkout">The Walkout</h2>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>The walkout was clearly done as a spur of the moment thing to make those who didn't walk out appear condemned while making those who <em>did</em> walk out appear as "the good ones". The people who performed the walkout now claim that they merely want me, personally, to be held responsible for my actions and to step down as a moderator... but that's not the whole story, is it?</p>
            <p>If the only thing the instigator of the walkout (I still don't know who's idea this was to begin with so I can't name names) wanted from me was to be held accountable for my actions and optionally step down, why wasn't this brought up to me personally? A moderator could point a finger at me, go "you did a bad thing and I don't want you serving as the leader of the community anymore."</p>
            <p>The best that could happen is I go "you're right" and step down. (I've said in private this would have probably been my response had I been accused earnestly, so I'm at least keeping my story straight on this.) The worst that could have happened was I ban the guy in a blatant abuse of power and then the rest of the group immediately shuns me for life for making a bad situation even worse and then the current server dies in a ball of internet drama.</p>
            <p>They had nothing to lose for coming to me directly and airing their greivances, but instead they chose to go behind my back and scheme this plan to publicly portray the mods as bad people.</p>
            <p>On a personal note I find it incredibly unbecoming of a moderator that they would be unwilling to discuss issues with other members of staff, and find that reflects poorly on their ability to govern a server. At this point, however, whether I remain on staff after the publication of this note is unrelated to whether the rest of staff should be reinstated - that is for the remainder to decide. I'm just stating my thoughts with this one.</p>
            <p>I have nothing concrete to say about the walkout, it just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to say something about this.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Personal Opinion</p>
            <p>After all of these situations came to a head I could only think one thing </p>
        <h1>Someone has an ulterior motive here.</h1>
            <p>I don't think it's Marr, and I have doubts it's actually anyone who signed that walkout post. I'm of the opinion Marr is the catalyst upon which someone is using this to take out frustrations against the mod team unjustly.</p>
            <p>Someone in that splinter friend group shuffled the needs of an abuse victim off of themselves when that victim came to them in her time of need until she was abused further. Someone in that group chose to take blackmail photos while in a position of power and notoriety that would have allowed them to take action against the issue.</p>
            <p>That's more or less what I'm trying to get at. This general mod walkout and subsequent callout document are not indicative of a power-hungry moderator with deep seated issues or a flagrant system of mod abuse that borders on illegal. This is a friend group torn apart by abuse, and an attempt to fix that that got out of hand and spilled over into the public unjustly. None of you should have been a part of this situation, and by pulling you in it's just left people scared, confused, and split many friends apart for not choosing to take sides in a situation.</p>
            <p>As a result, I choose to personally allege that whoever had a hand in spearheading the decision to walk out as staff members for the server <em>does not</em> have the best interests of the community in mind. Indeed, whoever did so is deliberately causing grief with the intent to fracture and confuse a larger community <em>and</em> a small friend group with the intention of sullying at least a few names, and even several good names based solely on who chose to still associate with us.</p>
            <p>This isn't me saying that the new r/Undertale server is full of bad actors: many of them I still consider nice people and several of whom genuinely showed interest in wanting to do events for the community. Hell, Bliv basically does half the work on the bots for every Halloween event. He's the guy! If you like what we did you'll love whatever he does later!</p>
            <p>But someone in there is manipulative, full stop. They wanted to use their clout to finally get back at someone they percieve as villainous and boy howdy did they get exactly what they wanted.</p>
        <hr>
            <p>As an additional note, unless the allegers were completely blind to what I was saying in the general 18+ chat, everyone who signed the accusation against me should know that I have a new job working at a school as an IT Tech Aide. This is what leads me to believe this is not just a deliberate attack but is also a <em>targeted</em> attack to defame me, as a CSAM scandal would specifically be a massive liability towards my new workplace.</p>
            <p>I was very open about this new job. I can't imagine it's more than coincidence.</p>

    <h1 id="thing-i-was-trying-to-get-at-but-couldn-t-word-properly">Thing I was trying to get at but couldn't word properly</h1>
        <p>Writing is hard, man. You pour your heart out onto the page and then reread it time and time and time again to make sure that nobody's gonna read it the wrong way. I wrote articles like these at a leisurely pace in the past to make it cathartic. Writing them under pressure makes it a draining and painful experience.</p>
        <p>So, screw it, heres the last outline bullet point that I wanted to say something about but couldn't quite get the words out. Unfiltered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hearing that people were already afraid to come at the admins is a little disappointing when im like sitting here going like "dude at some point we need more admins who can do stuff more often especially since we just lost our biggest backend guy" and i should have absolutely communicated the fact that I was invested in having more admins on the team. I'm really sad we ended up developing cliques when I had previously assumed the mod team was all on the same board.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
    <h1 id="letters">Letters</h1>
        <p>I said it before and I'll say it again: Those who have villified me have already made up their minds and do not want to keep in contact with me or the server. I doubt that's changing. People were pretty spiteful towards me immediately after the walkout regardless of what I said to them.</p>
        <p>But on the off chance they end up reading this document, allow me to say my final goodbyes.</p>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Bliv</p>
            <p>You are the most creative programmer I've met in a long time. You're dedicated and you are able to come up with incredible ideas on the spot. You have a gift. Don't squander it on shit you don't want to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Casey</p>
            <p>You're convicted. I mean that in a good way. You want to believe you're doing right and that you're justified in your actions. That's a great attribute in a leader and especially in someone who wants to keep friends together. Keep people you trust close to you and they'll open up about their greatest fears for you to help manage, but don't be afraid to come to other people for help... like I am afraid to.</p>

        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Kibi</p>
            <p>I don't think you need anything specifically from me. You already have friends who love you and hobbies you enjoy that bring plenty of light into your life.</p>
            <p>Don't forget that those people are there for you when you need them.</p>

            <p>We've drifted apart over time. I'm sorry things ended so poorly and that this is the note we've had to finish out on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-o">
            <p class="head">Marr</p>
            <p>You've had a rough life.</p>
            <p>I've opened some wounds that can never fully heal and the entirety of this situation has done nothing but tear apart any tenous relationship we may have had.</p>
            <p>But you've got a good heart. You want to help and you want to feel acknowledged after living a life where you've felt powerless and like a nobody in the crowd.</p>
            <p>You've got a lot on your plate right now. If you're open for recommendations I think you need to assess what's important in your life and what you have time for to focus on things that matter, or you're going to burn under the pressure. This isn't a slight - I just want you to protect yourself where you can.</p>
            <p>You can make it. Keep your head high and your dreams in reach.</p>
            <p>I'm sorry for what I've done to you, personally, and that we couldn't have left on better terms.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>I didn't have a concluding paragraph in mind when starting this. Ending things was never my strong suit, but I hope this document clears up a lot of the mist surrounding the whole situation. And, hopefully, stops people from going into my DMs and asking me if I'm a pedophile.</p>
        <p>If you've read all this and you're still cock-sure that I do not deserve a place as the owner of the server, then so be it. I'll step down and you can choose who you want to continue running the place.</p>
        <p>If I can't continue being your community leader, I hope you'll at least keep me on as a member, or even a friend.</p>
        <p>If this ends with us simply having two Undertale Discords that continue unrelated to each other, it is what it is. It's happened before and it'll keep happening again.</p>
        <p>After all, like I always say: servers are free.</p>
